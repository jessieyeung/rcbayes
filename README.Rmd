# rcbayes: Bayesian Rogers-Castro Migration Age Schedules
Date: 2021-01-30

The `rcbayes` package is an R package that contains functions to calculate and estiamte Rogers-Castro migration age schedules in a Bayesian framework.  It is in active development. 

`rcbayes` is a spin-off package that is called on by the `DemoTools` package, but can also be used as a stand-alone package. `DemoTools` is an R package that contains simple functions often used in demographic analysis. 

This project, including both the `rcbayes` and `DemoTools` packages, is commissioned by the [UN Population Division](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/) and financed by the [Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation](https://www.gatesfoundation.org/) as part of the [Making Family Planning Count](http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/projects/making-family-planning-count/index.shtml) project. This work is licensed under the MIT License. 

## Installation

You can install the released version of rcbayes from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("rcbayes")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jessieyeung/rcbayes")
```
## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(rcbayes)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
